! The modifiers that have to be assigned have to be cleared first
! This also have to be true for modifier that have keys that you intend to use
! lock has to be cleared because it is assigned to keycode 66
clear lock
! mod3 has to be cleared because it has to be reassigned
clear mod3
! mod4 has to be cleared because it contains Hyper_L which we want to assign
! to mod3
clear mod4

! The keycode 66 is the code associated originally to caps lock
keycode 66 = Hyper_L NoSymbol Hyper_L

! mod3 will now be activated when pressing the caps lock
add mod3 = Hyper_L
! mod4 will be activated with the WinKey
add mod4 = Super_L
