The size of a word depends on the architecture of the microprocessor. When this chapter was written in 2012, most computers had 64-bit processors, indicating that they operate on 64-bit words. At the time, older computers handling 32-bit words were also widely available. Simpler microprocessors, especially those used in gadgets such as toasters, use 8- or 16-bit words.", "notes": "How microprocessor uses data.", "spine_index": 8, "spine_name": "OEBPS/xhtml/CHP001.html", "start_cfi": "/2/4/2/20[S0040]/12[S0085]/8[P0380]/1:0", "style": {"kind": "color", "type": "builtin", "which": "yellow"}, "timestamp": "2025-03-18T11:10:04.276Z", "toc_family_titles": ["1.
